# New to Matrix

You will need:

- an account on matrix
- someone else with an account on matrix

The simplest way to do that is to use the main element server
got to app.element.io and follow the account registration flow

until you have your matrix id

@username:domain.com

Congratulations, you're no longer new to matrix and have graduated to [current user of matrix](./current.html).
